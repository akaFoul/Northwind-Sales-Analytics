# Northwind-Sales-Analytics
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the Northwind Traders dataset—a well-known sample database representing a fictitious company that imports and exports specialty foods around the world. The objective was to uncover actionable insights from operational and sales data to drive better business decisions.

This end-to-end analytics project provided a 360-degree view of Northwind’s business landscape. It enabled data-driven decision-making through the integration of advanced SQL querying, statistical insights, and modern business intelligence tools.
